                <p data-aos="flip-right">From the six shows that Gorillaz have
                    already played in Latin America in recent
                    weeks, it is possible to get an idea of what
                    will be presented on the Tour. The
                    skeleton of the setlist is similar, despite
                    the space for small new features, as was
                    the case in Mexico (Saturnz Barz), Chile
                    (The Pink Phantom), Uruguay (Cracker
                    Island, Silent Running, Rockit and more).</p>

            <p>The band is made up of four lively
                members: 2-D, Murdoc, Noodle and
                Russell. The group's music is the
                result of collaboration between several
                other musicians, with Damon Albarn
                being the only permanent member.
                Their musical style is typically
                classified as alternative rock, although
                there is a lot of influence from Britpop,
                dub and electronica.</p>
